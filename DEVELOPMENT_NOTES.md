# To do

* Allow users to put comments in input files -> Arthur
* Improve output files from D0FUS_2D_Scan_generic -> Arthur
* Create a directory with examples of input files -> Eric
* Put all comments in English
* Put all variable names in English
* Move D0FUS_run.py into D0FUS instead of D0FUS/D0FUS_BIB
* Put more explicit comments in D0FUS_parameterization.py, e.g. for beta_T and ITERP -> Timothé

# For discussion

* Remove D0FUS_2D_Scan.py and use only D0FUS_2D_Scan_generic.py (and rename it D0FUS_2D_Scan.py)?
* Remove Graphs directories?
